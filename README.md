 I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in analyzing and interpreting data to extract meaningful insights. I’m excited to apply my growing skill set in statistics, Python programming, and data visualization to solve real-world problems and drive data-driven decisions.

🔍 **Skills & Expertise:**
- **Data Wrangling:** Proficient in cleaning and organizing datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, and Excel to prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I love diving into datasets to uncover trends, relationships, and anomalies through visualizations and statistical techniques.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating clear and effective visualizations with tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI to present insights in a digestible format.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying fundamental statistical methods for hypothesis testing, A/B testing, and data interpretation.

💻 **Technologies I’m Exploring:**
- **Python & Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
- **SQL:** Writing complex queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from relational databases.
- **BI Tools:** Familiar with Power BI and Tableau for building interactive dashboards and visual reports.



🛠 **Projects I’m Working On:**
Check out my repositories for personal and academic projects where I analyze real-world datasets, build predictive models, and showcase my findings through visualizations. My projects range from customer segmentation, sales forecasting, to sentiment analysis.

🌱 **Continuous Learning:**
I’m always expanding my knowledge through online courses, personal projects, and reading. Currently, I’m learning more about Data Analaytics.

🤝 **Let’s Collaborate:**
I’m always open to new ideas, projects, and learning opportunities! Feel free to check out my repositories and get in touch if you’re interested in collaborating or providing feedback. Let’s build something awesome together!
